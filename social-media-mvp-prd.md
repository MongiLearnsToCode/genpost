The platform enables users to create, customize, and schedule content across Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook from a single interface, with AI-powered assistance and analytics to optimize posting strategy.

**Problem Statement:** Content creators and small businesses struggle with managing multiple social media accounts efficiently, often posting the same content across platforms without optimization, missing optimal posting times, and lacking insights into content performance.

**Goal:** Create an intuitive, AI-enhanced social media management tool that simplifies cross-platform posting while providing actionable insights to improve engagement and reach.

## 2. Goals

1. **Streamline Content Creation:** Reduce time spent creating and posting content across multiple platforms by 70%
2. **Platform Optimization:** Enable automatic content customization for Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook formats
3. **Intelligent Scheduling:** Provide AI-driven recommendations for optimal posting times and content strategy
4. **Performance Insights:** Deliver actionable analytics to help users improve content performance
5. **Team Collaboration:** Support small team workflows with shared calendars and basic collaboration features
6. **User Acquisition:** Achieve 100 active users within first 3 months of launch
7. **Revenue Generation:** Convert 15% of users to paid plans within first 6 months

## 3. User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**As an influencer,** I want to create one post and have it automatically formatted for Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, so that I can maintain consistent presence across platforms without manual reformatting.

**As a soloprenuer,** I want AI to suggest the best times to post my content, so that I can maximize engagement without researching optimal timing myself.

**As a small business owner,** I want to see which of my posts perform best across platforms, so that I can create more of the content my audience enjoys.

**As a content creator,** I want a quick posting mode for urgent or spontaneous content, so that I can share timely updates without going through a complex creation process.

**As a team member,** I want to view and edit our shared content calendar, so that I can coordinate with my teammates and avoid posting conflicts.

**As a busy entrepreneur,** I want to schedule multiple posts in advance, so that I can maintain social media presence even when I'm focused on other business activities.

### Secondary User Stories

**As a data-driven marketer,** I want to export my post performance data, so that I can analyze it in my preferred analytics tools.

**As a team admin,** I want to manage billing and team member limits, so that I can control costs and access as our team grows.

**As a new user,** I want guided onboarding to connect my social accounts, so that I can start using the platform immediately without confusion.

## 9. Implementation Decisions & Answers to Key Questions

### 9.1 Content Moderation
For the MVP launch, the platform will not include automated content filtering or moderation features. Users are responsible for ensuring their content complies with platform policies. This reduces initial development complexity while focusing on core functionality.

### 9.2 Timezone Handling
The system will automatically detect user timezone via browser geolocation API. If location permission is denied or detection fails, users will be prompted to manually select their timezone from a dropdown menu. All scheduled posts will display in the user's local timezone with automatic daylight saving time adjustments.

### 9.3 Failed Post Recovery
When posts fail to publish due to platform issues, the system will automatically attempt republishing up to 3 times using exponential backoff (1 min, 5 min, 15 min intervals). If all retries fail, the system will notify the user via in-app notification and send an alert to the developer for investigation.

### 9.4 Team Billing Structure
Team billing operates per-team with shared post limits distributed based on team size:
- **2-3 members:** 1.5x individual plan limit (e.g., $19 plan = 300 posts/month for team)
- **4-6 members:** 2x individual plan limit (e.g., $19 plan = 400 posts/month for team)  
- **7+ members:** 3x individual plan limit (e.g., $19 plan = 600 posts/month for team)
Team admins can view usage breakdown by member and manage billing through their account dashboard.

### 9.5 Data Retention Policy
User posts and analytics data will be retained for 2 years after account deletion to support potential account recovery and historical analysis. Users can request complete data deletion within 30 days of account closure. Active accounts have unlimited data retention for post history and analytics.

### 9.6 API Change Management
The system will monitor social media platform developer announcements and maintain a 30-day buffer for implementing critical API updates. Users will receive in-app notifications for service disruptions and email updates for major changes. A developer alert system will flag breaking changes requiring immediate attention.

### 9.7 Integration Testing Approach
Comprehensive integration testing will be implemented using live social media APIs with dedicated test accounts. Testing will cover OAuth flows, post publishing, webhook callbacks, rate limiting, and error scenarios. A staging environment with full platform integrations will enable continuous testing throughout development.

### 9.8 Post History & Export Features
Users can view all published posts in a searchable history interface, duplicate past posts for rescheduling, and instantly repost content to any platform. Post history can be exported as an editable Google Doc format including content, timestamps, and basic performance metrics.

### 9.9 Privacy & User Tracking
The system will track essential user behavior for product improvement including page views, feature usage, and error rates. All tracking will be anonymized and aggregated for analytics. Personal content and private information will not be tracked beyond necessary functionality. Users will be informed of data collection practices through privacy policy.
